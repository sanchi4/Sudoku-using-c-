# Sudoku-using-c-
A 9*9 grid will be displayed to the user and each time the user will be asked to enter a number and the position where he wants to insert it. This will continue until the user solves the whole Sudoku or he gives up and asks us to print the solved Sudoku.

This program involves splitting the terminal into two using the tmux command,so that both the sudoku and timer are managed under the same terminal.
